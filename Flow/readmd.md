They included this description:

We hope you brought your threat modeling experience. Today we have three open sourced AWS architecture diagrams for you to inspect and see if you can spot the flaws. Each diagram has at least one element that doesn't belong, spot the flaws and identify what the system is designed to do and you'll solve this little game.
