#Technical Support 50 points - Warmups - easy


Author: @JohnHammond#6971

Want to join the party of GIFs, memes and emoji spam? Or just want to ask a question for technical support regarding any challenges in the CTF?

This CTF uses support tickets to help handle requests. If you need assistance, please create a ticket with the `ctf-open-ticket` channel. Do not bother DM-ing organizers or facilitators, they will just tell you to open a ticket. You might find a flag in the ticket channel, though!
