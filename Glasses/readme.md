# Glasses Warmups - easy
Author: @JohnHammond#6971

Everything is blurry, I think I need glasses!

## Solution

When visiting the site,  the first thing I noticed was the blurry line between the two paragraphs. ![Glasses-1](images/Glasses-1.png)

When inspecting the page source found what looks like the flag. ![Glasses-2](images/Glasses-2.png)

Modified the string around by adding `{` and `}` where expected for a flag of  `flag{8084e4530cf649814456f2a291eb81e9}`
